# Agent Reconstruction Rules

The reconstruction model is: move behavior from one large bot bin into specialized Agent bins without changing observable behavior.

Rules:

1. Preserve NuTNNuT source/master bot behavior until a later removal phase explicitly changes it.
2. Refactor first, redesign behavior later.
3. Do not rename packages only and call it migrated.
4. Every moved subsystem needs parity tests before old code is deleted.
5. Temporary compatibility wrappers must be obvious and removable.
6. New Agent modules must not depend on `server.bots` as a permanent design.
7. Cosmic writes should gradually move behind `server.agents.integration` gateways.
8. Dialogue, metrics, and side effects should move toward events/listeners.
9. Profiles and policies should make old behavior replaceable without changing runtime infrastructure.
10. Removal decisions happen only after the behavior is isolated and documented.

Recent reconstruction notes:

- Report helper orchestration now has an Agent-owned facade in
  `AgentBotChatReportRuntime`; `BotChatReportRuntime` remains only as a
  temporary compatibility shim for legacy bot package callers.
- Status helper orchestration now has an Agent-owned facade in
  `AgentBotChatStatusRuntime`; `BotChatStatusRuntime` remains only as a
  temporary compatibility shim for legacy bot package callers.
- Build/AP/SP/job callback orchestration now has an Agent-owned facade in
  `AgentBotBuildRuntime`; `BotChatBuildRuntime` remains only as a temporary
  compatibility shim for legacy bot package callers.
- Pending chat-action state, callbacks, and skill-report decision application
  now have an Agent-owned facade in `AgentBotPendingActionRuntime`;
  `BotChatPendingActionRuntime` remains only as a temporary compatibility shim
  for legacy bot package callers.
- Utility chat callbacks now have an Agent-owned facade in
  `AgentBotUtilityRuntime`; `BotChatUtilityRuntime` remains only as a
  temporary compatibility shim for legacy bot package callers.
- Social/fame chat callbacks now have an Agent-owned facade in
  `AgentBotSocialRuntime`; `BotChatSocialRuntime` remains only as a temporary
  compatibility shim for legacy bot package callers.
- Transfer/item-query chat callbacks and async transfer result routing now have
  an Agent-owned facade in `AgentBotTransferRuntime`; `BotChatTransferRuntime`
  remains only as a temporary compatibility shim for legacy bot package callers.
- Supply request callbacks and request-upgrade supply routing now have an
  Agent-owned facade in `AgentBotSupplyRuntime`; `BotChatSupplyRuntime` remains
  only as a temporary compatibility shim for legacy bot package callers.
- Session/relog/logout/away callback orchestration now has an Agent-owned
  facade in `AgentBotSessionRuntime`; `BotChatSessionRuntime` remains only as a
  temporary compatibility shim for legacy bot package callers.

Initial reconstruction order:

1. Runtime shell and registry.
2. Command parser/router boundaries. Initial parser and GM command bridge completed; old bot runtime remains underneath.
3. Chat/reply/dialogue boundaries. Reply queue primitive has moved to Agent commands; named random dialogue pools and away/logout/support/heal/buff/proactive/SP-variant/help/equipment-recommendation/fame/skill-report/trade-choice/pending-action-cancel/movement-stats-unavailable/supply-shortage/no-items/grind-start fixed prompt lines and buff-consumable mode labels have moved to Agent dialogue catalog; movement/follow/fidget, supply-request/direct supply, query/toggle, support/heal/buff toggle/replies, logout/relog/away session request and confirmation normalization, respec, upgrade-request, report/debug, trade/drop/item and pending drop-choice, trade-invite/shop/maker utility, equipment/autoequip, greeting/fame/self-target, build/job/AP/SP classification/replies, SP variant labels, pending chat action labels, trade category labels, skill-tree choice resolution, AP-build choice resolution, and job advancement resolution have moved to Agent dialogue classifiers/resolvers; session request routing/reply selection, pending chat-action branching/replies, away prompt/choice routing/replies, AFK welcome-back routing/reply selection, chat toggle routing/replies, buff query routing, respec routing, equipment chat routing/replies, recommended-gear reply selection, supply request routing/outcome reply selection, social/fame command routing, fame outcome routing/reply selection, movement/greeting chat routing/reply selection, utility chat routing/reply selection, SP/AP build selection routing/replies, help/report-query routing/help-line ownership, transfer command/item-query/weird-transfer routing/result routing, job-advancement routing/reply selection, skill-report/skill-tree-choice routing/model ownership, top-level chat route ordering, reply runtime ownership, Agent-owned bot reply adapter ownership, Agent-owned bot scheduler adapter ownership, Agent-owned bot status-state adapter ownership, Agent-owned recommended-gear cooldown state adapter ownership, Agent-owned AFK/offline return side-effect adapter ownership, Agent-owned gear-suggestion action adapter ownership, Agent-owned report offer action adapter ownership, Agent-owned supply report data adapter ownership, Agent-owned character report data adapter ownership, Agent-owned inventory report data adapter ownership, Agent-owned skill report data adapter ownership, Agent-owned build/status check adapter ownership, Agent-owned active-mode side-effect adapter ownership, Agent-owned range report data adapter ownership, Agent-owned movement report data adapter ownership, Agent-owned combat/buff report data adapter ownership, Agent status-state runtime ownership, Agent status-check, active-mode preparation, gear-suggestion cooldown, offline-return announcement, AFK-return announcement, and AFK tick callback orchestration ownership, Agent report scheduling runtime ownership, Agent status/report scheduling bridge ownership, Agent report action construction ownership, Agent-owned report operation adapter ownership, Agent-owned report delivery adapter ownership, direct report callback-operation wiring ownership, help report queueing ownership, single-line and multi-line report queueing ownership, skill-report decision orchestration ownership, recommended-gear report orchestration and reply selection ownership, report bridge ownership, report callback scheduling ownership, pending-action state/callback bridge ownership, session/relog/logout/away side-effect bridge ownership, manual supply/request-upgrade bridge ownership, async transfer/item-query bridge ownership, social/fame bridge ownership, toggle/buff/respec control bridge ownership, Agent-owned control callback adapter ownership, equipment chat bridge ownership, Agent-owned equipment callback adapter ownership, utility chat bridge ownership, build/AP/SP/job-advance bridge ownership, status/welcome-back bridge ownership, movement/greeting bridge ownership, same-package reply/status runtime wiring, PQ reply-runtime wiring, handled-state runtime bridge ownership, and direct orchestrator-context adapter wiring have moved to Agent dialogue flow orchestration; stats/range/build/crit/EXP/supply/meso/scroll/movement report formatting and basic stats/build/range/crit/EXP/meso/skill/movement/inventory-slot/inventory-summary/potion-count/buff-summary/autopot-debug/skill-buff-debug/combat-debug/grind-start report builders, range stat labels, potion type labels, fame reply formatting, no-items category formatting, buff debug-state formatting, skill-buff age/status formatting, combat debug stat formatting, grind-start low-supply formatting, build prompt wording, drop-or-trade prompt formatting, offline welcome-back map fallback formatting, selected catalog-template formatting, AP-build profile labels/job-display/skill-tree/learned-skill formatting, and item query normalization have moved to Agent dialogue; thin bot-side classifier, basic report/drop-or-trade/basic reply-pool pass-through wrappers, report helper shims, BotChatManager queue/status shims, and `BotChatReplyRuntime` have been removed; `AgentBotReplyRuntime`, `AgentBotSchedulerRuntime`, `AgentBotStatusRuntime`, `AgentChatStatusRuntime`, `AgentChatReportRuntime`, `BotChatRuntime`, `BotChatOrchestratorContext`, `BotChatReportRuntime`, `BotChatPendingActionRuntime`, `BotChatSessionRuntime`, `BotChatSupplyRuntime`, `BotChatTransferRuntime`, `BotChatSocialRuntime`, `BotChatControlRuntime`, `BotChatEquipmentRuntime`, `BotChatUtilityRuntime`, `BotChatBuildRuntime`, `BotChatStatusRuntime`, and `BotChatMovementRuntime` are temporary adapters from Agent chat orchestration/reply/report/scheduling/status-state/pending-action/session/supply/transfer/social/control/equipment/utility/build/status/movement runtime to bot runtime side effects; `BotChatManager` is now only a legacy compatibility facade over `BotChatRuntime`.
4. Movement and navigation.
5. Combat.
6. Loot and supplies.
7. Inventory, equipment, trade, shop, and build.
8. Quest, NPC, and PQ.
9. Dialogue, social, and LLM.
10. SPI/Cosmic gateway attachment.
11. Delete old bot-shaped runtime once all callers use Agent modules.
